# Final_project

## By John Byun, Kat Anggasastra, Melissa Wright and Molly Cox
### [With additional technical support from tutors Mark Steadman,  Alexis McKenzie, and Earnest Long Jr.]
## The Task
1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing
2. Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
3. Use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machine learning library. We use: Prophet  https://facebook.github.io/prophet/
4. Use at least two of: We Use:  Python Pandas , Python Matplotlib , HTML/CSS, JavaScript Plotly
5. 15-minute data deep-dive or infrastructure walkthrough that shows machine learning in the context of what weâ€™ve already learned.
6. Examples: Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression. We use: Prediction and Regression

### Datasets

#### Temperature Data found in Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalTemperatures.csv
Original Source is Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study, a group affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
We are interested in Average Yearly Land and Ocean Data from 1990 on.
